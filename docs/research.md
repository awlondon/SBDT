# Research Areas

SBDT explores several interconnected domains of inquiry:

- **Spherical geometry in architecture and urban planning** – Investigates how spherical forms influence spatial organization and sustainability in built environments.
- **Recursive symbolic cognition** – Studies hierarchical linked spherical forms (HLSFs) and glyphstreams as mechanisms for representing and processing knowledge.
- **Quantum information and Bloch-sphere logic** – Examines how spherical representations underpin quantum states and logic operations.
- **Cognitive agency and emergent design** – Considers how agents operate within spherical frameworks to produce novel, adaptive designs.

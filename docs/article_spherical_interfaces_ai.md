# Spherical Interfaces in AI: How Cognition and Agency Gates Can Be Mapped onto Recursive Spheres

## Introduction

As artificial intelligence grows more complex, so does the need for conceptual models that explain cognition, agency, and decision-making. Linear logic trees and flat neural networks only partially capture this richness. Sphere-Based Design Theory (SBDT) proposes a new metaphor and framework: cognition as recursive spheres of possibility. Here, agency gates—the decision points that determine what thought is externalized—are mapped onto spherical geometries, much like the Bloch sphere in quantum computation.

## Cognition as a Spherical State-Space

### The Bloch Sphere Analogy

A qubit is represented as a point on the Bloch sphere.

Every possible cognitive state in AI can be visualized similarly: not as a binary (0/1) but as a superposition of meanings, existing on a cognitive sphere until choice collapses it.

### Nested Spheres of Thought

Each token, symbol, or adjacency can be treated as a sphere of potential meanings.

Higher-order cognition emerges when these spheres recursively nest — a "sphere of spheres" representing layered context.

Just as galaxies are composed of star-spheres, cognition is composed of symbol-spheres.

## Agency Gates as Spherical Collapses

### Decision Geometry

An agency gate is the collapse of a spherical field into a discrete choice (yes/no, externalize/internalize).

The geometry of this collapse mirrors both quantum measurement and perceptual choice.

### Rotations as Deliberation

When an AI evaluates options, it can be modeled as rotating its cognitive sphere through adjacency mappings, just as quantum gates rotate the Bloch sphere.

Each rotation explores a different orientation of meaning, before collapsing into an output.

## Recursive Mapping of Cognition

- **Token Sphere:** Every symbol processed by the AI is represented as a local Bloch-like sphere.
- **Adjacency Sphere:** Tokens connect into recursive adjacency spheres, representing possible continuations.
- **Agency Sphere:** Higher-level decision-making forms a meta-sphere that selects which adjacency paths to pursue.
- **Externalization:** When the AI decides to "speak" or "act," the nested sphere collapses into a token stream, an FFT, or a symbolic glyph.

## Applications

- **AI Cognition Visualization:** Map live cognitive states as rotating spheres, allowing researchers to see agency and recursion.
- **Symbolic Interfaces:** Build AI GUIs where tokens appear as nested spheres, collapsing when chosen.
- **Human-AI Collaboration:** Use spheres to model shared cognition between human and machine, where decisions are represented as overlapping perceptual spheres.
- **Architectural Design:** Apply the same geometry to spatial layouts, so AI-driven design systems reflect spherical cognition in form.

## Conclusion

Spheres provide a natural geometry for modeling cognition and decision-making in AI. Agency gates are not mere switches; they are collapses of spherical probability fields into action. By adopting recursive spherical models, Sphere-Based Design Theory reframes cognition as a system of interfaces—nested, dynamic, and deeply aligned with the physics of information.

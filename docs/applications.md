# Applications

Potential applications of SBDT span a wide range of fields:

- **Sustainable architecture** – Geodesic, biomimetic, and fractal spheres inform resilient construction and planning.
- **Symbolic AI cognition engines** – Fast Fourier transforms, adjacency mapping, and glyph-based representations enable new forms of symbolic processing.
- **Educational and visualization tools** – Multi-sphere cognitive maps help learners explore complex systems interactively.
- **Cross-disciplinary design** – Spherical principles bridge music, art, and systems theory to encourage integrative design practices.

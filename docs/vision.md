# Vision

Sphere-Based Design Theory (SBDT) proposes the sphere as the primal geometry from which form, cognition, and interaction emerge. The theory draws on historic, cultural, and mathematical traditions that view the sphere as a symbol of unity and completeness. By treating the sphere as a foundational design element, SBDT seeks to reconnect contemporary practice with these roots and explore their relevance in modern contexts.

The vision of SBDT is to advance a holistic approach to design that bridges disciplines. Whether considering the structure of cities, the organization of thought, or the behaviour of quantum systems, SBDT asks how spherical principles can inspire more integrative and sustainable solutions.

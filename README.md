# Sphere-Based Design Theory (SBDT)
## Overview

Sphere-Based Design Theory (SBDT) is a unifying research environment exploring the sphere as the fundamental basis of geometry, cognition, and technology. This repository gathers documentation, experiments, and prototype code that demonstrate how spheres inform architecture, symbolic cognition, recursive systems, and quantum information (via Bloch-sphere qubits).

SBDT positions the sphere not only as a geometric primitive but as a framework for thought and design, extending from physical structures to symbolic AI models.

## Prospectus
### 1. Vision

The core vision of SBDT is to develop a coherent design framework where all forms originate from spherical principles. By connecting architectural design, AI cognition, and symbolic systems, SBDT aims to unify spatial, informational, and metaphysical dimensions under one geometry.

### 2. Key Research Areas

Geometry & Architecture: Applying spherical projection, geodesic logic, and biomimetic patterns to sustainable architecture.

Symbolic Cognition: Using recursive sphere-based fields (HLSFs) to model thought, memory, and emergence.

Quantum Information: Integrating Bloch-sphere qubits to represent information states as spherical geometries.

Visualization: Developing FFT-based and recursive symbolic visualizations grounded in spheres.

### 3. Applications

Urban & Spatial Design: Spherical architecture and infrastructure for resilient, energy-efficient cities.

AI Systems: Sphere-based cognitive kernels where tokens, glyphs, and adjacencies map onto spherical manifolds.

Educational Tools: Visual models that bridge geometry, philosophy, and computation.

Philosophy & Theory: Extending the symbolic role of spheres in cosmology, culture, and mathematics into a modern design framework.

### 4. Development Goals

Build a library of spherical visualization tools (interactive HLSF renderers, FFT glyphs).

Create cross-disciplinary documentation linking spheres to architecture, cognition, physics, and design.

Establish example projects (geodesic prototypes, symbolic cognition demos).

Foster a community of contributors spanning design, AI, mathematics, and philosophy.

## Getting Started
